# Pause Timer

Flipper app to ensure that you don't miss parts of your show when using the bathroom during an ad break! This app will play a pre-recorded IR signal back on a countdown, there are a few use cases but it was developed specifically for the ad thing.

## Use cases
- Pause a show when an ad break ends in case you're away from the TV.
- Set a timer to turn off your TV to enforce screen time limits.

2. Select the **LEARN** button to learn an IR signal from your remote (in the future this will store across runs).
3. Input your countdown duration.
3. Press **START** to start the timer.
4. When the timer completes, the app will transmit your saved signal!
